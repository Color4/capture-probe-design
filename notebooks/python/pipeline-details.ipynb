    "\n",
    "* First, we can add sequences for regions we are interested in using the white clover EST/transcript database. For example, only linamarase was a hit to the transcriptome but I suggest we design probes for all _CYP79D15_ and _Li_ sequences that are currently published, including flanking regions. However, this will only be a fraction of the 0.7 Mbp. \n",
    "* We could also just design 200, 400, 600 and 800 bp probes for random stretches of transcript sequences, targeting only those that were not homologous to red clover exons. While not homologous to red clover exons, these transcripts still represent sequences being expressed by white clover and may be sequences unique to white clover. While some of these probes risk overlapping exon boundaries and not binding, I don't think this will be much of an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Should we BLAST the final set of exons against itself to check for repetitive segments? My sense is that we don't have to since the probe design company screens for repeats as part of their pipeline. "
